# Instructions:

## Prerequisite: 
The following is going to assume you have Jupyter or IPython Notebooks installed on your computer. If this is not the case you may want to head over to their [website](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) and follow the instructions to get a fresh install. 

### Steps:
* First you'll want to either clone this repository via terminal (or command line) onto your computer or download the zip which should be an option above.
* After that if you've installed jupyter correctly the only remaining step is to navigate into the recently cloned/downloaded folder and run the following command:
```
jupyter notebook
```
* This should open a page in your default web browser. Then just click on 'PokitDok_Data_Visualization.ipynb' to open it and run the cells for the visualization.
